# Alternative Export Methods for RouteWise

Since the right-click download isn't working as expected, here are proven methods to get your complete project:

## Method 1: View and Copy File Contents

1. **Click on any file** in the Files tab to open it
2. **Select All** (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A) the file content
3. **Copy** (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C) the content
4. **Create the file locally** and paste the content
5. **Save with the same filename and extension**

## Method 2: Use File URLs

Some files can be accessed directly via URL. Try opening:
- `https://your-repl-url/client/src/App.tsx`
- Right-click and "Save Page As" might work for code files

## Method 3: Export via Shell (if available)

If you have shell access:
```bash
# Create a clean copy without git
mkdir /tmp/routewise-export
cp -r . /tmp/routewise-export/
cd /tmp/routewise-export
rm -rf .git node_modules .cache
# Then zip or tar the contents
```

## Method 4: Replit Teams Export

If you have Teams access, there might be export options in the Teams interface.

## Method 5: Manual File Recreation

For essential files, I can show you the complete content of each file so you can recreate them locally.

## Key Files Content Available

I can provide the full content for any of these files:
- package.json
- All configuration files
- All React components
- All server files
- All documentation

Would you like me to show you the complete content of specific files so you can copy them manually?
